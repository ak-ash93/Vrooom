# VRoom Frontend

This is the frontend part of the VRoom application, built with React and Vite.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the `Frontend` directory.
3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server with hot module replacement.

## Building

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

## Linting

To run the linter:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for any linting errors.

## Fonts

The project uses the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts and a custom font "Rg" located in the `public/fonts` directory.

## Notes

- The project uses React Router DOM for navigation between pages.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components.
- The `heading-font` class is defined in App.css and uses the custom "Rg" font.
- The `Home` component uses a background image loaded from Cloudinary.
- The login pages (`Userlogin` and `Driverlogin`) use state variables to manage email and password inputs.
- The `.env` file in the root directory is used to store environment variables.
